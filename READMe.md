- Design Choices
> Bento Box Style Layout:
    - The homepage features a bento-style layout, organizing content into visually appealing and structured sections.

> Overflowing Image Style (Cat):
    - An intentionally overflowing image (cat) adds a dynamic, playful touch to the design.

- Challenges Faced

- Solutions Implemented
> Flex Wrap for Responsiveness:
    - Utilized flex-wrap to manage the stacking and reflowing of elements within the bento boxes.

> Image Position Adjustments:
    -Modified the values for the imageâ€™s position to control overflow behavior effectively.

> Media Queries for Adaptability:
    - Applied media queries to fine-tune layout and image behavior for different screen sizes.
